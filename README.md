# Pancake
Using Tectonic + Pandoc + custom filters for scientific writing.
This project is a docker image that contains various tools to write scientific papers in Markdown.
All this is made for [Pandoc v2.10](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc).

# Usage

This project is a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/). This means that Pancake runs in a containerized machine based on Alpine linux. Inside that container, tools needed to use Pandoc and Tectonic are installed. In order to launch Pancake on a project, you first need to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Then to run the converter use the following command:

        docker run -d -v $PWD:/data -e PANDOC_OPTIONS="--listings --top-level-division=chapter --number-sections" -e PANDOC_OUTPUT="thesis.pdf" -e PANDOC_INPUT="*.md" --name pancake grea09/pancake

The following options may be of use:

* `-v`: volume mount. Use `/data` as the working directory.
* `PANDOC_OPTIONS`: options to give to `pandoc`
* `PANDOC_INPUT`: input files to be converted
* `PANDOC_OUTPUT`: output file
* `PANDOC_TYPE`: output type, if unspecified it is inferred from output's extension.
* `PANCAKE_ONCE`: if defined, will end the container after the first conversion attempt. Otherwise, `pandoc` will be invoked on every file change until the container is manually stopped.

# Configuration

Pancake will search for `.yaml` files in the working directory. For convenience, you may put them in a `style` folder. All style files will be read in the alphabetical order. The YAML files can contain any Pandoc metadata variables (except for font specification).

## Font specification

To specify a font you need to define it either using Pandoc's `fontfamily` variable or using the following:

        fonts:
          a-font: Times New Roman
          my-font:
            font: Arial # Main font
            regular: Arial
            italic: Arial Italic
            bold: Arial Black
            bold-italic: Arial Bold Italic
            slanted: Verdana
            bold-slanted: Verdana Bold
            smallcaps: Times New Roman
            scale: 1.2
            color: magenta
            options: #fontspec options as a string list

The name of the font will be the key suffixed with `font` (here `my-fontfont`). To define default fonts, name your font one of the following:

        main:
        sans:
        mono:
        math:
        cjk:

## Element style

In order to change the appearance of the different elements in the document one must use the following:

        elements:
          my-element:
            theorem: #or
            block: true
            prefix:
             - singularForm
             - pluralForm
            ref: shortcode for refs
            font: macroFontName
            color: Blue
            title: 
              font: anotherMacro
              background: Grey
            style:
            border:
            background:
            options: #latex options as a string list
            number: section

The following elements can be styled:

        code: #verbatim code
        algorithm: #Enables algorithmx
        document: #Title is main title, number is page number and only box.background change the page color. Style is pagestyle.
        chapter:
        section:
        figure:
        table:
        equation:

## List options

Several lists of elements can be used in each document. Lists are tables that enumerates elements of a certain type and some of their properties. For example list of figures with their caption or various table of content or glossary. To change their display, use the following:

        lists:
          my-list: #Enables the list
            title: Super List
            depth: 4
            columns: 3 #Requires multicol

Here is the list of lists:

        glossary:
        figures:
        content:
        tables:

## Links color

In order to change the default link colors, one must use the following:

        links:
          colors:
            link: Cyan
            cite: Grey
            url: Blue
            file: Green

## Latex Commands

For convenience, a new latex command parameter has been added to define custom LaTeX command:

        macro:
          - name: definition
          - bb: \mathbb
          â€¦




# Filters

### pancake_blocks
Main component for scientific writing. It is an old personal filter that evolved a lot with time.
Strongly inspired by [pandoc-amsthm](https://github.com/ickc/pandoc-amsthm) it mainly adds cref support.
Here is an example of its usage with the fenced divs of Pandoc 2:

        ::: {.definition #def:resolver name="Resolvers"}
        A resolver is a potential causal link defined as a tuple $r = \langle a_s, a_t, f\rangle$
        ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## pancake_algorithm
Also, one can use code blocks to write pseudocode using

        ~~~ {.algorithm #alg:example name="A smart caption" startLine="1"}
        \Function{example}{Stuff $s$, Problem $\mathcal{P}$} \EndFunction
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
